                        5G Shop is relatively new e-shop aiming to change the way on online shopping.<br>
                        Our goal is to make online shopping much more easier and user-friendly!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Established in March 2024 by four men, 5G Shop brings completely new concept of 
                        purchasing a smartphone, whether you are looking for a new one or used one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before us, a person had to visit tens of shops in order to find a right smartphone, 
                        in a right condition and, of course, for the reasonable price. Such process could have 
                        taken days or weeks, and in some cases even months. With 5G Shop such problems will 
                        be removed!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How do we work? Let's explain!<br>
                        There are two types of users in our e-shop - customers and resellers. Each type of users 
                        have different way of usage. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a person is visiting our website as a customer, he can visit our shop, select a model 
                        of a wished smartphone found through the searchbar, via filters or via the main shopping page. 
                        After choosing which smartphone a person wants, by pressing button 'buy' he is able to see 
                        all resellers which have such smartphone for sale and, of course, for each reseller his price. 
                        A person is also able to see specifications of each bid from resellers and the condition od the 
                        smartphone. By clicking on 'add to cart' button a person select a smartphone he wants to buy and 
                        he can continue exploring the rest of the shop or just go to the cart and finish the shopping. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a person is visiting our website as a reseller, he can visit our shop, however, he is not able 
                        to add a product to the cart as resellers do not have such privilege. However, resellers have an 
                        ability through their personal dashboard to upload an available smartphone for sale, which will 
                        then be added to the shop so customers can see it and consider for buying.
